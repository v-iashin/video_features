`video_features` allows you to extract features from raw videos in parallel with multiple GPUs.
It supports several extractors that capture visual appearance, optical flow, and audio features.

Action Recognition

- [I3D-Net RGB + Flow (Kinetics 400)](https://v-iashin.github.io/video_features/models/i3d)
- [R(2+1)d RGB (Kinetics 400)](https://v-iashin.github.io/video_features/models/r21d)

Sound Recognition

- [VGGish (AudioSet)](https://v-iashin.github.io/video_features/models/vggish)

Optical Flow

- [RAFT (FlyingChairs, FlyingThings3D, Sintel, KITTI)](https://v-iashin.github.io/video_features/models/raft)
- [PWC-Net (Sintel)](https://v-iashin.github.io/video_features/models/pwc/)


Image Recognition

- [ResNet-18,34,50,101,152 (ImageNet)](https://v-iashin.github.io/video_features/models/resnet)
