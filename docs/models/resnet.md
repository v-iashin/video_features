The [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) features are extracted at each frame of the provided video.
The ResNet is pre-trained on the 1k ImageNet dataset.
We extract features from the pre-classification layer.
The implementation is based on the [torchvision models](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.6.0/torchvision/models.html#classification).
The extracted features are going to be of size `num_frames x 2048`.
We additionally output timesteps in ms for each feature and fps of the video. We use the standard set of augmentations.

## Set up the Environment for ResNet
Setup `conda` environment. Requirements are in file `conda_env_torch_zoo.yml`
```bash
# it will create a new conda environment called 'torch_zoo' on your machine
conda env create -f conda_env_torch_zoo.yml
```

## Examples
Start by activating the environment
```bash
conda activate torch_zoo
```

It is pretty much the same procedure as with other features.
The example is provided for the ResNet-50 flavour, but we also support ResNet-18,34,101,152.
You can specify the model with the `model_name` parameter
```bash
python main.py \
    feature_type=resnet \
    model_name=resnet50 \
    device="cuda:0" \
    video_paths="[./sample/v_ZNVhz7ctTq0.mp4, ./sample/v_GGSY1Qvo990.mp4]"
```
If you would like to save the features, use `--on_extraction save_numpy` (or `save_pickle`) â€“ by default,
the features are saved in `./output/` or where `--output_path` specifies.
In the case of frame-wise features, besides features, it also saves timestamps in ms and the original fps of
the video into the same folder with features.
```bash
python main.py \
    feature_type=resnet \
    model_name=resnet50 \
    device="cuda:0" \
    on_extraction=save_numpy \
    file_with_video_paths=./sample/sample_video_paths.txt
```
Since these features are so fine-grained and light-weight we may increase the extraction speed with batching.
Therefore, frame-wise features have `--batch_size` argument, which defaults to `1`.
```bash
python main.py \
    feature_type=resnet \
    model_name=resnet50 \
    device="cuda:0" \
    batch_size=128 \
    video_paths="[./sample/v_ZNVhz7ctTq0.mp4, ./sample/v_GGSY1Qvo990.mp4]"
```
If you would like to extract features at a certain fps, add `--extraction_fps` argument
```bash
python main.py \
    feature_type=resnet \
    model_name=resnet50 \
    device="cuda:0" \
    extraction_fps=5 \
    video_paths="[./sample/v_ZNVhz7ctTq0.mp4, ./sample/v_GGSY1Qvo990.mp4]"
```
