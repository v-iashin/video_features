The extraction of an [18-layer R(2+1)D (RGB-only)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11248) network is borrowed from [torchvision models](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.5.0/torchvision/models.html#resnet-2-1-d). Similar to [I3D](i3d.md), R(2+1)D is pre-trained on [Kinetics 400](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics). The features are extracted from the pre-classification layer of the net. Therefore, it outputs a tensor with 512-d features for each stack. By default, [according to torchvision docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.5.0/torchvision/models.html#video-classification), it expects to input a stack of 16 RGB frames (`112x112`), which spans 0.64 seconds of the video recorded at 25 fps. Specify `--step_size` and `--stack_size` to change the default behavior. In the default case, the features will be of size `Tv x 512` where `Tv = duration / 0.64`. The augmentations are similar to the proposed in [torchvision training scripts](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/1aef87d01eec2c0989458387fa04baebcc86ea7b/references/video_classification/train.py#L154-L159).

## Set up the Environment for R(2+1)D
Setup `conda` environment. Requirements are in file `conda_env_torch_zoo.yml`
```bash
# it will create a new conda environment called 'torch_zoo' on your machine
conda env create -f conda_env_torch_zoo.yml
```

---

## Minimal Working Example

```bash
# Activate the environment
conda activate torch_zoo

# extract features from "./sample/v_GGSY1Qvo990.mp4" video and show the predicted classes
python main.py \
    feature_type=r21d \
    video_paths="[./sample/v_GGSY1Qvo990.mp4]" \
    show_pred=true
```

---

## Example
Start by activating the environment
```bash
conda activate torch_zoo
```

It will extract R(2+1)d features for sample videos using 0th and 2nd devices in parallel. The features are going to be extracted with the default parameters.
```bash
python main.py \
    feature_type=r21d \
    device_ids="[0, 2]" \
    video_paths="[./sample/v_ZNVhz7ctTq0.mp4, ./sample/v_GGSY1Qvo990.mp4]"
```
See [I3D Examples](i3d.md). Note, that this implementation of R(2+1)d only supports the RGB stream.
