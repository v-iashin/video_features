# Extract Video Features Using Multiple GPUs

This is the source code for `video_features`, a small library that allows you to extract features from raw videos using the pre-trained nets. So far, it supports several extractors that capture visual appearance, calculates optical flow, and, even, audio features.

The source code was intended to support the feature extraction pipeline for two of my papers ([BMT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08271) and [MDVC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07758)). This small library somehow emerged out of that code and now has more models implemented.
