# Video Features

<img  src="https://github.com/v-iashin/v-iashin.github.io/raw/master/images/video_features/vid_feats.gif" width="300" />

`video_features` allows you to extract features from raw videos in parallel with multiple GPUs.
It supports several extractors that capture visual appearance, optical flow, and audio features.
See more details in [Documentation](https://v-iashin.github.io/video_features/).

## Quick Start

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1csJgkVQ3E2qOyVlcOM-ACHGgPBBKwE2Y?usp=sharing)

```bash
# clone the repo and change the working directory
git clone https://github.com/v-iashin/video_features.git
cd video_features

# install environment
conda env create -f conda_env_torch_zoo.yml

# load the environment
conda activate torch_zoo

# extract r(2+1)d features for the sample videos
python main.py \
    feature_type=r21d \
    device_ids="[0]" \
    video_paths="[./sample/v_ZNVhz7ctTq0.mp4, ./sample/v_GGSY1Qvo990.mp4]"

# use `device_ids="[0, 2]"` to run on 0th and 2nd devices in parallel
```

## Ideas for Contributions

I would be happy to consider your ideas and PRs.
Here is a few things I have in mind:

- [ ] Docker image supporting all models
- [ ] PyTorch DDP support (for multi-node extraction)
- [ ] Refactor the code base with OOP in mind â€“ now the code is a bit redundant for each feature
- [ ] More models, of course
