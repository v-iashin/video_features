# Model
feature_type: 'clip'
model_name: 'ViT-B/32' # ViT-B/16 RN50x16 RN50x4 RN101 RN50
batch_size: 1 # Batchsize (only frame-wise extractors are supported)
extraction_fps: null # For original video fps, leave unspecified "null" (None)

# Extraction Parameters
cpu: false # using cpu. If cpu=true, `device_ids` has no use
device_ids: [0]  # list of device ids. Use [0, 2] to employ the 0th and 2nd devices.
on_extraction: 'print'  # what to do once the features are extracted. Can be ['print', 'save_numpy', 'save_pickle']
output_path: './output' # where to store results if saved
tmp_path: './tmp' # folder to store the temporary files used for extraction (frames or aud files)
keep_tmp_files: false # to keep temp files after feature extraction.
show_pred: false # to show preds of a model, i.e. on a pre-train dataset for each feature (Kinetics 400)
pred_texts: null # provide a list of multiple sentences.  if `null`, will perform zero-shot on Kinetics 400

# config
config: null

# Video paths
file_with_video_paths: null # if the list of videos is large, you might put them in a txt file, use this argument to specify the path
